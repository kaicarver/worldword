# worldword

To fully know a word, I need to know it in a half-dozen languages, maybe more.

I want a handy dictionary that tells me what a word is in a few languages, starting with the ones I know best.

## List of languages

The languages I know and use the most:

English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Russian

I'll probably want to have a few more languages to completely get a feel for the word as a representative of human experience:

For the West:

Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit

For the Mideast:

Hebrew, Arabic

For the East:

Japanese, Korean

And then more locally, in Western Europe:

Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, ...

etc...

## Existing resources

This kinda does what I want, and can serve as a reference, but I think I can do better: less boilerplate/advertising/whatnot, clearer presentation, customized to the languages I want, and more.
